Some lenders don\u2019t like these loans because the lenders, if they had to step into the shoes of the manager, are at the mercy of any rights (or lack thereof) the fund manager might have with respect to the partnership.  In the case of Dyal and BCP, I suspect CAZ has virtually none.  But in cases where there is demonstrated cash flow and the leverage is modest, this type of loan (often called a \u201cB\u201d line) is usually available at floating interest rates at 3-4% over prime.  The advantage of this loan arrangement is that the manager can borrow up to the specified max leverage amount (a function of capital committed) or pay it down as desired.  So in the case of CAZ, I suspect their loan facility will allow for immediate leverage for those investors that opt to use it.  There is frequently an \u201cunused commitment fee\u201d for undrawn amounts that the lender will charge.", "avatar": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/user_avatar/forum.506investorgroup.com/jaypruitt/45/6369_2.png", "topic_title": "CAZ - sponsor"}, {"username": "ErsinKececioglu", "cooked": "<p>Another reason why I don\u2019t like this deal is, it gives CAZ the power to get into any deal without a buyout from the investors.
