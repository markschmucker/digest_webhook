But I had a nagging sense that something wasn\u2019t right. So, I kept pushing. The company claimed to have just signed a deal with a major restaurant chain for $20M. I asked them to connect me with the restaurant chain so I could verify this. They said too many investors had already spoken with them and they did not want to request yet another reference call. My nagging sense turned into full-on, red-flag worry. I asked some connections I had at the restaurant chain to investigate for me. They came back and told me they had no deal with the startup.

Our portfolio company was unaware of this group, had never spoken with them nor given them the authority to syndicate their deal. And if you had invested with them, you would have done so based on incorrect information. This scenario is playing out weekly on AngelList.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering if due diligence really matters, if it really affects your investment returns. The answer is absolutely! According to the <a href=\"http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/data/Documents/Resources/AngelGroupResarch/1d%20-%20Resources%20-%20Research/6%20RSCH_-_ACEF_-_Returns_to_Angel_Investor_in_Groups.pdf\">largest study</a> of angel investors ever, conducted by the Angel Capital Association and the Kauffman Foundation: \u201cSpending time on due diligence is significantly related to better outcomes. Simply splitting the sample between investors who spent less than the median twenty hours of due diligence and investors who spent more shows an overall multiple difference of 5.9X for those with high due diligence compared to only 1.1X for those with low due diligence. The exits where investors spent more than 40 hours doing due diligence (the top quartile) experienced a 7.1X multiple.\u201d</p>\n<p>The importance of due diligence is clear. That\u2019s why our due diligence process is so rigorous. And yet we are seeing more and more syndicate leads sharing deals where they have no relationship with the companies. (Some syndicates rely on lead investors to conduct due diligence, but large firms often do only cursory due diligence on early-stage deals where they are investing small amounts in order to have the option to invest in the winners at a later stage. And you have no transparency into their level of due diligence and no opportunity to ask questions). These syndicates have not done even the most basic due diligence. They do not give you access to the founders in an exclusive webinar, as we always do, so you can meet the team and ask them questions before making your investment decision. They do not secure pro-rata rights, like we always do, so you have the opportunity to invest in future rounds. And they certainly do not have a written guarantee to receive regular investor updates from the company, as we always do, so you can keep up to date on the company\u2019s progress. And they don\u2019t do anything to help their portfolio companies succeed after investing, like we always do. How could they do any of these things? They have literally never even spoken to the companies.</p>\n<p>Where does that leave us? We clearly have a problem, but what can we do about it? At a very minimum, I propose that AngelList should require all syndicate leads to have a signed statement from the startup specifically giving the syndicate permission to syndicate the deal. I have suggested this to AngelList and I hope they will implement it. That would at least address the issue of syndicates not having the startups\u2019 permission to share the deal. But it doesn\u2019t address the issue of due diligence. That can only be solved by you. If you are selective about the deals you invest in and invest only in those where the syndicate lead has done extensive due diligence, you will not only earn much higher returns on your investments, but you may also force more syndicates to start protecting their investors through proper due diligence. You may also want to ask syndicate leads to share their entire track record. We share <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/141QztALPGXf2aPWOsNaMcjzMYSM_2W7htEsJAFqKFVA/edit?usp=sharing\">ours </a>and encourage others to as well.</p>\n<p>I understand that a skeptic could read my warning and interpret it as self-promotional. My goal, though, with this letter is not to encourage anyone to invest with Forefront. My goal is to share what I\u2019ve seen unfolding so that you and other angel investors can use this information for your benefit when evaluating any deals you see, from whatever source.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Phil</p>\n</blockquote>", "url": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/t/angellist-com-general/32051/18", "timestamp": "2022-01-22T01:54:09Z", "raw": "Sharing a note on AngelList I received from Phil Nadel at Forefront Venture Partners (affiliated with Barbara Corcoran - although I'm not sure how involved she is).

Simply splitting the sample between investors who spent less than the median twenty hours of due diligence and investors who spent more shows an overall multiple difference of 5.9X for those with high due diligence compared to only 1.1X for those with low due diligence. The exits where investors spent more than 40 hours doing due diligence (the top quartile) experienced a 7.1X multiple.\u201d\n>\n>The importance of due diligence is clear. That\u2019s why our due diligence process is so rigorous. And yet we are seeing more and more syndicate leads sharing deals where they have no relationship with the companies. (Some syndicates rely on lead investors to conduct due diligence, but large firms often do only cursory due diligence on early-stage deals where they are investing small amounts in order to have the option to invest in the winners at a later stage. And you have no transparency into their level of due diligence and no opportunity to ask questions). These syndicates have not done even the most basic due diligence. They do not give you access to the founders in an exclusive webinar, as we always do, so you can meet the team and ask them questions before making your investment decision. They do not secure pro-rata rights, like we always do, so you have the opportunity to invest in future rounds. And they certainly do not have a written guarantee to receive regular investor updates from the company, as we always do, so you can keep up to date on the company\u2019s progress. And they don\u2019t do anything to help their portfolio companies succeed after investing, like we always do. How could they do any of these things? They have literally never even spoken to the companies.\n>\n>Where does that leave us? We clearly have a problem, but what can we do about it? At a very minimum, I propose that AngelList should require all syndicate leads to have a signed statement from the startup specifically giving the syndicate permission to syndicate the deal. I have suggested this to AngelList and I hope they will implement it. That would at least address the issue of syndicates not having the startups\u2019 permission to share the deal. But it doesn\u2019t address the issue of due diligence. That can only be solved by you. If you are selective about the deals you invest in and invest only in those where the syndicate lead has done extensive due diligence, you will not only earn much higher returns on your investments, but you may also force more syndicates to start protecting their investors through proper due diligence. You may also want to ask syndicate leads to share their entire track record. We share [ours ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/141QztALPGXf2aPWOsNaMcjzMYSM_2W7htEsJAFqKFVA/edit?usp=sharing)and encourage others to as well.\n>\n>I understand that a skeptic could read my warning and interpret it as self-promotional. My goal, though, with this letter is not to encourage anyone to invest with Forefront. My goal is to share what I've seen unfolding so that you and other angel investors can use this information for your benefit when evaluating any deals you see, from whatever source.\n>\n>Best,\n>\n>Phil", "avatar": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/user_avatar/forum.506investorgroup.com/andrewhoffman/45/4873_2.png", "topic_title": "AngelList.com - General"}], "slug": "angellist-com-general", "topic_emblem_or_color": "F7941D"}, {"topic_url": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/t/craig-davis-properties-cdp-triangle-off-market-gp-fund/18576", "topic_categories": ["Deals", "Equity"], "topic_tags": ["special-terms", "gp-fund", "equity-mixed-fund", "deal-is-open"], "topic_name": "Craig Davis Properties - CDP Triangle Off-Market GP Fund", "posts": [{"username": "JoeTeichman", "cooked": "<p>I\u2019m not negating the risks, but IMO if the properties were not entitled and it was just raw dirt, then at that point it\u2019s all speculation and appraisals don\u2019t mean much.

We would not move forward with Mission Valley unless we were able to secure land lease terms that provided the opportunity to achieve acceptable risk adjusted return that were accretive to our investors.**  \n\u2022\tWhat the approximate terms are that they think they will have to pay for the land lease, both up-front payments to secure the lease, as well as annual lease payments? \n**Forthcoming.** \n\u2022\tAny details that can be shared on the rent from the current tenants?\n**Forthcoming.**\n\u2022\tWill CDP have to pay the real estate taxes owed in the land lease?\n**This is still a negotiation point but the lessee typically is responsible for the taxes which is what we have assumed in our underwriting.** \n\u2022\tHow much less is the land worth in a ground lease to the LP (because the CDP Fund will have to contribute up to 10% equity, and ground lease land is worth less) - meaning, they will have to come up with more cash to make the ground component worth more.\n**The fund will still contribute the value of the land into the GP position of the vertical construction.  The value is typically calculated using a NPV with a discount rate on the amount of the ground lease for that particular phase.  This will not require additional equity to participate in the vertical.** \n\u2022\tWhat is the plan on funding all of this cashflow to secure the lease, and then start demolition on part of the site?\n**The cost for the fund to secure the lease will be minimal.  The demolition costs will be part of the vertical construction costs.**", "avatar": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/j/c0e974/45.png", "topic_title": "Craig Davis Properties - CDP Triangle Off-Market GP Fund"}], "slug": "craig-davis-properties-cdp-triangle-off-market-gp-fund", "topic_emblem_or_color": "0088CC"}, {"topic_url": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/t/market-commentary/11396", "topic_categories": ["Public Securities", "Public Securities General"], "topic_tags": [], "topic_name": "Market Commentary", "posts": [{"username": "Paul_Szilassy", "cooked": "<p>I have a respectful counterview.

Due to the performance of the asset, we would like to remind the partners and highlight that the accrued distributions that were on hold in 2020 due to COVID-19 uncertainty were fully repaid during 2021.</p>\n<p>At this time, we are pleased to announce additional good news. After reviewing the asset\u2019s 2022 budget, the rosy economic outlook for this market and future expected performance of the project, we believe it is prudent to increase the distributions to 10% annum based on each partner\u2019s original capital basis. The increased distributions will start with the January 2022 distributions, which will be paid in February as they are paid in arrears.</p>\n<p>We are pleased with the performance of the asset thus far and continue to be excited about the future prospects of the business center and the continued growth of the Southeast market.

Given the increased demand for single story, private entrance office space in the Southeast market, any future vacancies should be easily re-leasable, keeping the asset's occupancy on target with the original offering memorandum.\n> \n> The asset has met all expectation and performed well since acquisition, finishing 2021 with an occupancy rate of 90% and a collection rate for the year of 100%. Due to the performance of the asset, we would like to remind the partners and highlight that the accrued distributions that were on hold in 2020 due to COVID-19 uncertainty were fully repaid during 2021.\n> \n> At this time, we are pleased to announce additional good news. After reviewing the asset's 2022 budget, the rosy economic outlook for this market and future expected performance of the project, we believe it is prudent to increase the distributions to 10% annum based on each partner's original capital basis. The increased distributions will start with the January 2022 distributions, which will be paid in February as they are paid in arrears.\n> \n> We are pleased with the performance of the asset thus far and continue to be excited about the future prospects of the business center and the continued growth of the Southeast market. We will be sending a detailed quarterly report next month.

But I had a nagging sense that something wasn\u2019t right. So, I kept pushing. The company claimed to have just signed a deal with a major restaurant chain for $20M. I asked them to connect me with the restaurant chain so I could verify this. They said too many investors had already spoken with them and they did not want to request yet another reference call. My nagging sense turned into full-on, red-flag worry. I asked some connections I had at the restaurant chain to investigate for me. They came back and told me they had no deal with the startup.

Our portfolio company was unaware of this group, had never spoken with them nor given them the authority to syndicate their deal. And if you had invested with them, you would have done so based on incorrect information. This scenario is playing out weekly on AngelList.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering if due diligence really matters, if it really affects your investment returns. The answer is absolutely! According to the <a href=\"http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/data/Documents/Resources/AngelGroupResarch/1d%20-%20Resources%20-%20Research/6%20RSCH_-_ACEF_-_Returns_to_Angel_Investor_in_Groups.pdf\">largest study</a> of angel investors ever, conducted by the Angel Capital Association and the Kauffman Foundation: \u201cSpending time on due diligence is significantly related to better outcomes. Simply splitting the sample between investors who spent less than the median twenty hours of due diligence and investors who spent more shows an overall multiple difference of 5.9X for those with high due diligence compared to only 1.1X for those with low due diligence. The exits where investors spent more than 40 hours doing due diligence (the top quartile) experienced a 7.1X multiple.\u201d</p>\n<p>The importance of due diligence is clear. That\u2019s why our due diligence process is so rigorous. And yet we are seeing more and more syndicate leads sharing deals where they have no relationship with the companies. (Some syndicates rely on lead investors to conduct due diligence, but large firms often do only cursory due diligence on early-stage deals where they are investing small amounts in order to have the option to invest in the winners at a later stage. And you have no transparency into their level of due diligence and no opportunity to ask questions). These syndicates have not done even the most basic due diligence. They do not give you access to the founders in an exclusive webinar, as we always do, so you can meet the team and ask them questions before making your investment decision. They do not secure pro-rata rights, like we always do, so you have the opportunity to invest in future rounds. And they certainly do not have a written guarantee to receive regular investor updates from the company, as we always do, so you can keep up to date on the company\u2019s progress. And they don\u2019t do anything to help their portfolio companies succeed after investing, like we always do. How could they do any of these things? They have literally never even spoken to the companies.</p>\n<p>Where does that leave us? We clearly have a problem, but what can we do about it? At a very minimum, I propose that AngelList should require all syndicate leads to have a signed statement from the startup specifically giving the syndicate permission to syndicate the deal. I have suggested this to AngelList and I hope they will implement it. That would at least address the issue of syndicates not having the startups\u2019 permission to share the deal. But it doesn\u2019t address the issue of due diligence. That can only be solved by you. If you are selective about the deals you invest in and invest only in those where the syndicate lead has done extensive due diligence, you will not only earn much higher returns on your investments, but you may also force more syndicates to start protecting their investors through proper due diligence. You may also want to ask syndicate leads to share their entire track record. We share <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/141QztALPGXf2aPWOsNaMcjzMYSM_2W7htEsJAFqKFVA/edit?usp=sharing\">ours </a>and encourage others to as well.</p>\n<p>I understand that a skeptic could read my warning and interpret it as self-promotional. My goal, though, with this letter is not to encourage anyone to invest with Forefront. My goal is to share what I\u2019ve seen unfolding so that you and other angel investors can use this information for your benefit when evaluating any deals you see, from whatever source.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Phil</p>\n</blockquote>", "url": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/t/angellist-com-general/32051/18", "timestamp": "2022-01-22T01:54:09Z", "raw": "Sharing a note on AngelList I received from Phil Nadel at Forefront Venture Partners (affiliated with Barbara Corcoran - although I'm not sure how involved she is).

Simply splitting the sample between investors who spent less than the median twenty hours of due diligence and investors who spent more shows an overall multiple difference of 5.9X for those with high due diligence compared to only 1.1X for those with low due diligence. The exits where investors spent more than 40 hours doing due diligence (the top quartile) experienced a 7.1X multiple.\u201d\n>\n>The importance of due diligence is clear. That\u2019s why our due diligence process is so rigorous. And yet we are seeing more and more syndicate leads sharing deals where they have no relationship with the companies. (Some syndicates rely on lead investors to conduct due diligence, but large firms often do only cursory due diligence on early-stage deals where they are investing small amounts in order to have the option to invest in the winners at a later stage. And you have no transparency into their level of due diligence and no opportunity to ask questions). These syndicates have not done even the most basic due diligence. They do not give you access to the founders in an exclusive webinar, as we always do, so you can meet the team and ask them questions before making your investment decision. They do not secure pro-rata rights, like we always do, so you have the opportunity to invest in future rounds. And they certainly do not have a written guarantee to receive regular investor updates from the company, as we always do, so you can keep up to date on the company\u2019s progress. And they don\u2019t do anything to help their portfolio companies succeed after investing, like we always do. How could they do any of these things? They have literally never even spoken to the companies.\n>\n>Where does that leave us? We clearly have a problem, but what can we do about it? At a very minimum, I propose that AngelList should require all syndicate leads to have a signed statement from the startup specifically giving the syndicate permission to syndicate the deal. I have suggested this to AngelList and I hope they will implement it. That would at least address the issue of syndicates not having the startups\u2019 permission to share the deal. But it doesn\u2019t address the issue of due diligence. That can only be solved by you. If you are selective about the deals you invest in and invest only in those where the syndicate lead has done extensive due diligence, you will not only earn much higher returns on your investments, but you may also force more syndicates to start protecting their investors through proper due diligence. You may also want to ask syndicate leads to share their entire track record. We share [ours ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/141QztALPGXf2aPWOsNaMcjzMYSM_2W7htEsJAFqKFVA/edit?usp=sharing)and encourage others to as well.\n>\n>I understand that a skeptic could read my warning and interpret it as self-promotional. My goal, though, with this letter is not to encourage anyone to invest with Forefront. My goal is to share what I've seen unfolding so that you and other angel investors can use this information for your benefit when evaluating any deals you see, from whatever source.\n>\n>Best,\n>\n>Phil", "avatar": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/user_avatar/forum.506investorgroup.com/andrewhoffman/45/4873_2.png", "topic_title": "AngelList.com - General"}], "slug": "angellist-com-general", "topic_emblem_or_color": "F7941D"}, {"topic_url": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/t/craig-davis-properties-cdp-triangle-off-market-gp-fund/18576", "topic_categories": ["Deals", "Equity"], "topic_tags": ["special-terms", "gp-fund", "equity-mixed-fund", "deal-is-open"], "topic_name": "Craig Davis Properties - CDP Triangle Off-Market GP Fund", "posts": [{"username": "JoeTeichman", "cooked": "<p>I\u2019m not negating the risks, but IMO if the properties were not entitled and it was just raw dirt, then at that point it\u2019s all speculation and appraisals don\u2019t mean much.

We would not move forward with Mission Valley unless we were able to secure land lease terms that provided the opportunity to achieve acceptable risk adjusted return that were accretive to our investors.**  \n\u2022\tWhat the approximate terms are that they think they will have to pay for the land lease, both up-front payments to secure the lease, as well as annual lease payments? \n**Forthcoming.** \n\u2022\tAny details that can be shared on the rent from the current tenants?\n**Forthcoming.**\n\u2022\tWill CDP have to pay the real estate taxes owed in the land lease?\n**This is still a negotiation point but the lessee typically is responsible for the taxes which is what we have assumed in our underwriting.** \n\u2022\tHow much less is the land worth in a ground lease to the LP (because the CDP Fund will have to contribute up to 10% equity, and ground lease land is worth less) - meaning, they will have to come up with more cash to make the ground component worth more.\n**The fund will still contribute the value of the land into the GP position of the vertical construction.  The value is typically calculated using a NPV with a discount rate on the amount of the ground lease for that particular phase.  This will not require additional equity to participate in the vertical.** \n\u2022\tWhat is the plan on funding all of this cashflow to secure the lease, and then start demolition on part of the site?\n**The cost for the fund to secure the lease will be minimal.  The demolition costs will be part of the vertical construction costs.**", "avatar": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/j/c0e974/45.png", "topic_title": "Craig Davis Properties - CDP Triangle Off-Market GP Fund"}], "slug": "craig-davis-properties-cdp-triangle-off-market-gp-fund", "topic_emblem_or_color": "0088CC"}, {"topic_url": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/t/market-commentary/11396", "topic_categories": ["Public Securities", "Public Securities General"], "topic_tags": [], "topic_name": "Market Commentary", "posts": [{"username": "Paul_Szilassy", "cooked": "<p>I have a respectful counterview.

If they have a fund and its 90% invested and they are lending at 12% then they are netting 10.8% so they would be making a 0.5% spread which is crazy low.  If they have a fund paying you 10.3% unleveraged, what are they lending at and what types of deals are they invested in?  Also why would they use investor money at 10.3%?

Below was his response, and i think it was worth sharing with the group: \n\n> I don't understand how they are making any money.  If they have a fund and its 90% invested and they are lending at 12% then they are netting 10.8% so they would be making a 0.5% spread which is crazy low.  If they have a fund paying you 10.3% unleveraged, what are they lending at and what types of deals are they invested in?  Also why would they use investor money at 10.3%?

As we have additional time to complete our diligence, we are able to extend our subscription period to February 18, 2022. As a reminder, we are seeking to raise approximately $56 million in equity to complete this transaction and have received approximately $35 million in soft commitments to date. We remain confident in our ability to raise the required equity and are working with our own networks as well as a few select advisors in an effort to raise the remaining funds. We are very excited about this opportunity and look forward to closing this transaction!  As always, thank you for your continued support.", "avatar": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/s/76d3ee/45.png", "topic_title": "Cook Properties - NY Portfolio Acquisition"}], "slug": "cook-properties-ny-portfolio-acquisition", "topic_emblem_or_color": "0088CC"}, {"topic_url": "https://forum.506investorgroup.com/t/crowdstreet-denholtz-deerfield-corporate-park/6717", "topic_categories": ["Deals", "Equity"], "topic_tags": ["equity-office", "deal-is-closed", "crowdfunded"], "topic_name": "[Crowdstreet] Denholtz - Deerfield Corporate Park", "posts": [{"username": "RobertFakheri", "cooked": "<p>Good news.
